- Wait-to-start behavior is somewhat non-discoverable.
- Start should offset by +3s (only on start?  Only when first room is siris?)
- Need room names!
- detect Snes9x freeze load screen?
- events should use absolute offsets, instead of durations.
- show expected time left

Confused Timer:
- the reference room getting ahead is super-bad
- seems we should only allow the reference room to scan more than 3 on a boss room, or when behind.
- should assume linear room order, but not update the last matched room?

Extra Draygon rooms problem:
- increase room threshold (what is the shortest room transition in the game?)
- ignore room transitions from BOSS -> BOSS (trouble with first room after boss?)
- look for doors in room transition (trouble with siris?)

Movie import:
- Run the import on a background thread (NSOperation?  How to report progress?)

Future thoughts:

One way to represent a run is as a series of events.

- start transition
- end transition
- start item
- end item

and to sum up game time, wall time, etc. from those events.

start: 0.0, <datetime>
door: 10.5
room: 10.8
map: 12.3, <mapstate>
item: 12.8
