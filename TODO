- Be able to read from a saved FLV file
- some rooms (like dragon) are dark enough to be transitions
- pause screen causes a room change


Future thoughts:

One way to represent a run is as a series of events.

- start transition
- end transition
- start item
- end item

and to sum up game time, wall time, etc. from those events.

What is my value add?
Splits.  Difference from last run.

In the first approximation, I can keep a list of transitions/rooms
and tell you how you compare to the time after that many transitions on a previous run.

Make it wait for the game to actually start counting?
 - Set a "running" flag and then only start the run when we exit a transition.
