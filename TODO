- Wait-to-start behavior is somewhat non-discoverable.
- Start should offset by +3s (only on start?  Only when first room is Ceres?)
- detect Snes9x freeze load screen?
- events should use absolute offsets, instead of durations.
- show expected time left
- the last split is never saved for the run
- saving a new reference should reload the reference file.
- When you stop a run, it probably open the run file?
- Blackout mode
- Forward-looking franken-run to inform when to abort.
- Only make Timer window "status level" when emulator/vlc is front-most.

REGRESSIONS:
- Incremental matching is now O(N^2) (doesn't matter, except for lots of logging!)

- Need to separate "state" from "event type".
Item, Room, Map, Pause? are all "room state" events.
Cutscene, Door are not?

Confused Timer:
- the reference room getting ahead is super-bad
- seems we should only allow the reference room to scan more than 3 on a boss room, or when behind.
- should assume linear room order, but not update the last matched room?

Extra Draygon rooms problem:
- increase room threshold (what is the shortest room transition in the game?)
- ignore room transitions from BOSS -> BOSS (trouble with first room after boss?)
- look for doors in room transition (trouble with Ceres?)

Better Sequence Matching:
- Start the search at the matching index in the reference run.
- Search 0, -1, +1, -2, +2.. -6, +6
- Start the search at the last matched room + number of rooms since last match.
- Search -6, +6
- If the search fails, check to see if previousRoom - 1, exit == currentMapState
- Otherwise, assume previousRoom + 1?


Future thoughts:

One way to represent a run is as a series of events.

- start transition
- end transition
- start item
- end item

and to sum up game time, wall time, etc. from those events.

start: 0.0, <datetime>
door: 10.5
room: 10.8
map: 12.3, <mapstate>
item: 12.8
