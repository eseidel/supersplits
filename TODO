- Wait-to-start behavior is somewhat non-discoverable.
- Start should offset by +3s.
- detect snes freeze load screen?
- events should use absolute offsets, instead of durations.
- show expected time left


Future thoughts:

One way to represent a run is as a series of events.

- start transition
- end transition
- start item
- end item

and to sum up game time, wall time, etc. from those events.

start: 0.0, <datetime>
door: 10.5
room: 10.8
map: 12.3, <mapstate>
item: 12.8
